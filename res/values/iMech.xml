 <string name="Aquabooster">Want to build your own mini rocket launcher? AquaBooster provides you with an
opportunity to design and construct your very own hydro-powered rocket booster. An exhilarating
event requiring participants to create a powerful and effective rocket propeller within a specified
time constraint such that the judging criterion is based on the longest distance travelled.

Gear up and implement the legendary Newtons Third Law of Motion in actuality with AquaBooster.
Nevertheless power up your basics of aerodynamics and minimize the air resistance offered to
the flight of the missile. If you�re innovative enough then go ahead and plant a safety measure to
prevent accidental launches in your AquaBooster!

And remember the key to speed and acceleration lies in the amount of water filled into the plastic
bottle so that the pressure of the air pumped in must be able to thrust the water down and out of
the spout, driving the bottle�s flight into space.</string> 

 <string name="Armageddon">Heard of mechanical robotic arms made of motors, servos, wires..? Well we won�t require all that!
Armageddon is an event for making a mechanical arm using syringes and broken rulers!

What we�re looking at is robotic arms based on hydraulic systems built completely from scrap
that can match the functionality of industrial level grades. The arm should be able to lift and place
objects of different sizes and weights at certain places. The team with the most efficient arm in
terms of its load carrying capacity, grip and ease of lift wins.

Time to revise your Pascal�s Laws on fluid mechanics and design effective arms with correctly placed
joints for swift and balanced movements of your Armageddon!</string>
 

 <string name="Catapult">Played Angry Birds, right? This event here based on projectile shooting is nothing less than
an adaptation of the famous game. In this event you have to build a catapult i.e. launcher which can
throw or shoot a tennis ball up to certain length. The aim of the event is to test how precisely a
participant can give an impulse to the ball so that it hits the given target accurately.

In this event the catapult will have to destroy the enemy\'s castle made of thermocol. The
winner will be decided by number of shoots and accuracy of the catapult. Think smart and design an
out of the box system to strike at the best possible rate with amazing strength and hit rates.</string>

 <string name="Kinetize">Reflecting on the aeon with no electricity, solar power, batteries, hydro-power, thermal
energy, nuclear plants, there was a time where machinery was driven by pure mechanics!
Converting stored potential energy to kinetic was the only way to automate machines.

Kinetize is purely a mechanical event. In this event you have to build a machine to satisfy the
problem statement given and the machine should be working only on mechanical energy. You can
use springs, elastics or any other form of potential energy to drive the equipment for accomplishing
the requisite task. Great designs and accurate calculations are what matter in this ultimate
mechanical event!</string>
