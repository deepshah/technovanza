 <string name="Robowars">War brings destruction, war brings death but for the one
who shall witness it, it shall be a Roman royal experience.
To hear their applause you have to go mindless without
fear, beat the thrill and be ready for the kill.

Witness the experience of hell in a cell at Technovanza 13!
Robowars brought up in an enormous size this time to feel
the fight between robots meant for destruction.</string>
    
 
 <string name="Technoolympics">A 3 way mega-event, consisting of 3 separate events
altogether where you can use the same bots with some
or no addition and modification on the bot allowing a
participant to participate in all 3 events individually which
tests different aspects of the bot thus having 3 different
winners and also the techno-Olympics 3-way event winner
award. The 3 events are Monster Arena, Cable Crane and
RoboPirates.
So come with one single adaptable robot and win exciting
prizes from 3 different events!</string>

<string name="MonsterArena">As said, The one who is ahead of time is always that wins.
But all of us know the reason why it is difficult to complete things on
time. Reason-obstacles.

This is an opportunity to show how fast your bot is and your problem
solving skills for overcoming all the obstructions stopping you from
being on time to finish the track and thus being the winner!</string>

 <string name="CableCrane">This being the 2nd event consists of a different problem statement
from the others. Here your bot has to carry a set of goods. It faces a
different kind of a problem here. The goods cannot be carried by the
bot in a specific area due to specific reasons. But for help, a rope is
provided to carry goods from one place to another. So an extra pick-
up and rope traversing mechanism has to be made to carry good
through the rope. In the meanwhile your bot takes a long route to
pick up the goods. If the bot does not reach in time, line followers ie
thief bots might steal your goods. So hurry up!</string>

 <string name="RoboPirates">Construct a remote controlled bot, which can traverse on both land
and water. Think of different designs that will matter to complete the
task mentioned in the problem statements. Come and surprise how
evolved and effective your design can be! This can also be achieved
by modifying the monster arena bot.</string>

 <string name="SplitSecond">Come, build an IC engine car to complete and win by driving
through an all terrain track with sharp turns and big jumps. In
this competition both speed and control will matter. The car
should be able to cross bumps, jumps and other obstacles on
the track and outdo the opponents\' car while maintaining its
stability and not compromising on its pace. Get Set Go!</string>

 <string name="WallE">The event consisting of creating intelligent bots that will follow
commands given by the arena directly, which will be automated
itself.
The bot has to follow the directions given in forms of line following,
light following and wall following altogether. The bot that follows
these instructions in minimum time i.e. the one which is most
efficiently coded will be given the name of Wall-e.</string>

 <string name="MasterOfPuppets">Play god by making your bot a puppet controlled merely your hand
gestures. Fulfill your fantasy of having the best bot depicting the
fictional stuff portrayed in movies like Magneto in X-men and The
forceï¿½ Star-Wars. The bot will have to perform a task responding only
to the positions of your palm.</string>

 <string name="Vertigo">The enemy kingdom kidnaps the princess of our kingdom. We are
having a team of soldiers who will be of help for the leader to fight
against them, sadly our kingdom doesnt have a king.
So we are in search of that person to lead and get the queen back to
her castle and that person will be known as the king of the kingdom.

So you being the aspirant to be the king should be able to make a
controlled mechanism to lift objects from a height to the ground in
this test for speed, accuracy and precision.</string>
